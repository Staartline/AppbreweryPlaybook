			<h1>Grid</h1>
			<p>This is good for 2D Layouts or websites that have different sections.</p>
			<p>Flexbox VS Grid. Flexbox is good for aligning something on a 1D line. Grid is good for laying something out on a 2D grid or layout. There are some times where these tools might be better than another, or where both of these things can be implemented on a single page.</p>
			<p>A 1D grid layout will be different than a flexbox layout. This happens most with the spacing between each element on the page.</p>
			<p>You can combine flexbox with grids and grids with flexboxes to create a layout that you would like (they each have their own use cases).</p>

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<div class="example">
				< div class="container"><br>
					< p> content </ p><br>
					< p> content </ p><br>
					< p> content </ p><br>
				< /div><br>
				<br>
				<p>styles.css<p>
				<p>.container{<br>
					display:grid; <br>
					grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;<br>
					grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;<br>
					gap:10px;<br>
				}<br></p>
			</div>

			<p>The p elements will be the blocks. </p>
			<p>Default behavior will try to take up the whole width of the screen, so it might be good to define the width of the container.</p>
			<p>fr -> If we say 1fr 2fr, then we want the second column to be twice as large as the first one (1:2). This is the ratio of the page.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Grid Sizing</h2>
			<p>Grid-template-column/grid-template-rows -> We can define rows and columns of a grid using px, rem, or fr. Using REM or PX for the grid means that the grid will not be responsive. Using fr fits the grid to the screen.</p>
			<p>Grid-template: rows/columns -> We may also define both the rows and the columns of a grid using grid-template: rows / columns</p>
			

			<p>Auto -> We may also define rows and columns using the auto keyword. Columns will respond to the width of the screen. Rows will respond to the height of the content. </p>
			<p>fr -> used to divide the grid into ratios. if someone wrote 1fr 2 fr, the ratio of the columns would be 1:2. This grows and shrinks depending on the screensize, and the content width.</p>
			<p>minmax(min,max) -> used to define the min and max width that we want a column to be. </p>
			<p>repeat(times, size) -> used when we want to repeat something. We want to define repetition easily.  </p>
			<p>items are laid out in a F layout. Anything that is added after we have defined our rows and columns, then css will try to adjust for the new item </p>
			<p>grid-auto-rows -> when we create new rows, then this defines how new items are added to a grid.  </p>

			<p>We can use chrome developer tools to find out what is happening in our grid.</p>

				<p>You can have an easier time to visualize the number of rows and columns that you need inside of a container by drawing the prefered layout, then drawing the different boxes that you will need.</p>
