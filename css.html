	<h1>What is CSS | Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
	<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style language that is used to modify the look of a markup language. This language doesn't work on its own, but modifies the look of an existing file. All browsers have their own default CSS which we can change through our custom CSS.</p>
	<p>Before CSS, using HTML elements and attributes can be difficult as lots of code needs to be written to write something simple and making coding errors or spelling mistakes can be easy.</p>

	<p>Another way to think about this is that everything on a webpage is made of boxes that we can change, arrange, and style. Pesticide <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome/bakpbgckdnepkmkeaiomhmfcnejndkbi" target="_blank">Chrome</a> | <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pesticide-for-firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> is a useful extension to view the boxes that we are changing.</p>

	<h3>Comments</h3>
	<p>Comments are written in CSS using a /**/ format.</p>
	<p>EX -> /*comment goes here.*/</p>

	<h2>Types of CSS</h2>
	<!--Start of INLINE CSS-->
	<h3>Inline CSS using style attribute</h3>
	<p>We use inline CSS to write css in a specific HTML's tag using a style attribute. This can be something like changing a background color, or a font.</p>
	<p style="background:pink; font-family:roboto;">Ex -> We use a style tag to change the background and the font.</p>
	
	<p>How to set up Inline CSS</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Find an element that you would like to inject the CSS into. Ex -> p, h1, h3...</li>
		<li>Add in the style attribute. Ex -> p style=""</li>
		<li>Add in the desired properties. EX -> p style="font-family:roboto;"</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure that there is a colon(:) between the property and the value</li>
			<li>Make sure that the statement ends with a semicolon(;)</li>
			<li>Ensure that the statement is in double quotes("")</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Add in more properties if you want. EX -> p style="background:pink; font-family:roboto;</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Our difficulty here is that what if we wanted to change every element on the page? We would have to change all of the elements on the page to contain the same style attribute... There has to be an easier way...</p>

	<!--End of Inline CSS-->

	<!--Start of Internal CSS-->
	<h3>Internal CSS using the style element inside the head element</h3>
	<p>We use internal CSS when we want to change the way that every element (of the same type) looks on a page. This is done so that we don't need to change every single element individually when we want to update a page's appearance.</p>

	<p>How to set up Internal CSS</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Find the head element in your HTML document</li>
		<li>Insert the style element (< style> < /style>) into the head</li>
		<li>Choose an element that you would like to change (EX.body). The format is as follows: body{}</li>
		<li>Choose a property that you would like to change. The format is like so: body{background:pink; font-family:roboto;}</li>
	</ol>

	<!--End of Internal CSS-->

	<!--Start of External CSS-->
	<h3>External CSS</h3>
	<p>We use external CSS when you want the style to be applied across the entirety of the website without wanting to copy the internal CSS element to every page on a website.</p>
	<p>In short, the external css will modify the appearance of any page that links back to it.</p>
	<p>How to set up External CSS</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a css folder named css. This goes inside of your website's project folder.</li>
		<li>Inside of the css folder, create a file called styles.css</li>
		<li>Link the styles.css file to your HTML document. Do this by using the link element inside of the head element of your HTML file. (link rel="stylesheets" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css") </li>
			<ul>
				<li>By the way, if there is a / in /css/styles.css, the / in the front of the directory means that the file is located in the root, instead of the same directory level. If you remove the /, then the file is in the same directory as the current file that is calling it.</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	<!--End of External CSS-->
	<!--Start of Hierarchy-->
	<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
	<p>If we specify a CSS rule in two places, which one is applied? </p>
	<p>When writing CSS, more specific code overwrites the more general code. If you write a global rule, and then inline CSS, priority is given to inline CSS. With this in mind, you can apply specific changes to the code by writing inline CSS.</p>

	<p>Least Specific -> styles.css (External CSS)</p>
	<p>More Specific -> style element in the head element (Internal CSS)</p>
	<p>Most Specific -> element style="" (Inline CSS)</p>

	<p class="tips"> TIP! It is recommended that you apply all styles in your external CSS (styles.css) file.</p>
	<!--End of Hierarchy-->

	<!--Start of debugging-->
	<h2>Debugging</h2>
	<p>When code has errors such as logic issues or a spelling mistake, debugging is important!</p>
	<p>To debug, you should first try to identify a problem. For example, if you have inserted a CSS file but do not see any CSS, check the link for the css file. If there is an issue where parts of the css page is working but other elements are not, you can try checking for things such as a spelling error or for inline css.</p>
	<p>You can use the browser's built in developer tools to try to find issues. Chrome developer tools can be used to find missing files when running an HTML page. Developer tools can also tell us what types of styles are currently running on a page as well.</p>
	<p class="tips"> TIP! To ensure that CSS is working on the current page, make a dramatic change to part of the site's content, such as changing the background-color property, to check.</p>
	<!--End of Debugging-->

	<hr>
	
	<!--Start of CSS Syntax-->
	<h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
	<p>Syntax is the grammer of a programming language, and CSS syntax is no different. </p>
	<p>selector {property:value;}</p>

	<ul>
		<li>selector -> Who are we changing (p, h1, h2...ect.). </li>
		<li>property -> What are we changing (background-color, font-family, border...ect.). Multiple properties can be applied to the selector.</li>
		<li>value -> How are we changing the property (black, blue, roboto, dotted...). This depends on the property.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="tips"> The best practice for css is to put each changed property in alphabetical order. Ex -> p{background-color:orange; color:green; font-family:roboto;}</p>
	<p>All CSS Statements must end with a semicolon at the end of the statement.</p>

	<p>Selectors can be the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>classes -> .classname{}</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Used for more specific styling and targets specific elements. </li>
			<li>Can be used on multiple elements on a page.</li>
			<li>Can be used when you want to apply the same style to a group of elements.</li>
			<li>Elements are allowed to have more than one class. Ex.-> You can have a class for an element's color, and for the radius of an image.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>elements -> h1, p, div </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Targeting specific element tags will apply a change to every single instance of the tag. Ex -> Applying a red color to an img will apply the red color to every img on the page.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>ids -> #idname</li>
		<ul>
			<li>More specific than class selectors.</li>
			<li>Only one single instance per ID is allowed on a page while you can use classes on multiple places on the page.</li>
			<li>One ID can only be used for one element (Ie. A single unique element)</li>
			<li>ID is used sparingly, and it might be suggested against, but there are some cases where it might be useful.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>By the way, if you are changing multiple elements, such as h1 and h2, you can format the css like h1,h2{property:value;}</p>
	<p>If you mispell the selector or the properties, the CSS might not work correctly.</p>
	<p>Each element can only have ONE(1) ID. They can have multiple (MORE THAN ONE) classes, though! </p>
	<p>The hierarchy for changes is (least specific) element -> class -> (most specific) ID</p>


	<!--End of CSS Syntax-->
	<hr>

	<h3>Psuedoclasses</h3>
	<p>Classes can have different states. On occasion, if one would want to hover over the elements on a page, they can change.</p>
	<p>For example, if a user were to hover over an image, the background color of the image may change.</p>
	<p>EX -> img:hover{property:value}</p>

	<hr>

	<h2>Properties</h2>
	<p>How do we know what properties we can affect? There is css reference on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" target="_blank">MDN.</a></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color" target="_blank">background</a>-> Changes the background color. You can use a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php" target="_blank">color name</a>, or a <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank">hexcode</a> to change the color.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.php" target="_blank">border-style</a>-> Changes the border's style. This can be a border around an image or a textbox, for instance.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_height.php" target="_blank">height</a>-> This changes the height of our css box.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.php" target="_blank">width</a>-> can be done in a numberical or a percentage.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css_text.asp" target="_blank">Color</a>-> Changes the color of the font</li>
	</ul>
