			<h1>Grid</h1>
			<p>This is good for 2D Layouts or websites that have different sections.</p>
			<p>Flexbox VS Grid. Flexbox is good for aligning something on a 1D line. Grid is good for laying something out on a 2D grid or layout. There are some times where these tools might be better than another, or where both of these things can be implemented on a single page.</p>
			<p>A 1D grid layout will be different than a flexbox layout. This happens most with the spacing between each element on the page.</p>
			<p>You can combine flexbox with grids and grids with flexboxes to create a layout that you would like (they each have their own use cases).</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<div class="example">
				< div class="container"><br>
					< p> content </ p><br>
					< p> content </ p><br>
					< p> content </ p><br>
				< /div><br>
				<br>
				<p>styles.css<p>
				<p>.container{<br>
					display:grid; <br>
					grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;<br>
					grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;<br>
					gap:10px;<br>
				}<br></p>
			</div>

			<p>The p elements will be the blocks. </p>
			<p>Default behavior will try to take up the whole width of the screen, so it might be good to define the width of the container.</p>
			<p>fr -> If we say 1fr 2fr, then we want the second column to be twice as large as the first one (1:2). This is the ratio of the page.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Grid Sizing</h2>
			<p>An important thing to decide is how we want to size our grid to fit our columns and rows.</p>
			<p>Grid-template-column/grid-template-rows -> We can define rows and columns of a grid using px, rem, or fr. Using REM or PX for the grid means that the grid will not be responsive. Using fr fits the grid to the screen.</p>
			<p>Grid-template: rows/columns -> We may also define both the rows and the columns of a grid using grid-template: rows / columns</p>
			

			<p>Auto -> We may also define rows and columns using the auto keyword. Columns will respond to the width of the screen (attempts to go to 100%). Rows will respond to the height of the content. </p>
			<p>fr -> used to divide the grid into ratios. if someone wrote 1fr 2 fr, the ratio of the columns would be 1:2. This grows and shrinks depending on the screensize, and the content width.</p>
			<p>minmax(min,max) -> used to define the min and max width that we want a column to be. Setting a min size means that this is as small as the column will get.</p>
			<p>repeat(times, size) -> used when we want to repeat something. We want to define repetition easily.  </p>
			<p>items are laid out in a F layout. Anything that is added after we have defined our rows and columns, then css will try to adjust for the new item </p>
			<p>grid-auto-rows -> when we create new rows, then this defines how new items are added to a grid.</p>

			<p>We can use chrome developer tools to find out what is happening in our grid.</p>
			<p>When opening the inspector on firefox, if you use the layout tab, it will allow you to see if css grid is in use. </p>

display:grid;
grid-template-columns:auto 400px minmax(200px, 500px);
grid-template-rows:1fr 1fr 2fr;
grid-auto-rows:50px;

			<h2>Grid Placement</h2>
			<h3>Terms</h3>

			<h3>Positioning along a column</h3>
			<p>container/grid container -> Contains items. </p>
			<p>griditems/ -> </p>
			<p>tracks -> These are rows and columns that we make with grid-template-rows/columns</p>
			<p>tracks form grid cells. Multiple cells can make a grid item.</p>
			<p>Tracks are separeted by gridlines/gap</p>
			<p>by default, items are laid out to unoccupied cells. One per cell.</p>

			<p>grid-column -> grid-column:value ex grid-column:span 2 will make an item span two columns</p>
			<p>grid-column-start:start</p>
			<p>grid-column-end:ending -> if you specify a negative value , (-1), the rows are on the righthand most side. </p>
			<p>We can start and end in whichever position we would like. </p>
			<p>grid-column is short for grid-column-start and grid-column-end</p>
			<p>grid-row -> grid-row-start/ grid-row-end</p>

			<p>order -> each item has an order of 0 by default. By ordering the items, the greater they are, the farther into the grid they go. </p>
			<p>grid-area: grid-row-start/grid-column-start/grid-row-end/grid-column-end -> If we use this on an item, if we want the rest of the layout to act as expected, we need to lay out all the areas using the same property</p>
			<h3>Grid Rows</h3>

			<h3>Overlaying items</h3>
			<p>We may overlay items atop another on grid. </p>
