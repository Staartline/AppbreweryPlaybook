	<h1>Filepaths</h1>
	<p>These are locations for files and folders on one's computer. These are used to direct a user to a specific file on the computer.</p>
	<h2>Absolute</h2>
	<p>This is a filepath that is relative to the root of the computer. </p>
	<h2>Relative</h2>
	<p>This is a filepath that is relative to the folder that the current file is residing inside. These are shorter, and are valid as you move some folders around.</p>

	<p>current directory is the folder in which the project file is located inside.</p>
	<p>../ -> means to go up a level/folder</p>
	<p>./ -> stay within the current directory</p>


	<h2>Webpages</h2>
	<p>These are the different files that have information. They go into the same folder. We must refer to these files in different files to be able to navigate them.</p>
