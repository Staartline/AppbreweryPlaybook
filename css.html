	<h1>What is CSS</h1>
	<p>Once upon a time, people wanted to style their websites, and used to use HTML attributes. However, there is an issue when you work with wanting to lay out parts of a site with HTML. Lots of code has to be written to do something simple, and it is easy to make an error.</p>
	<p>Cascading Style Sheets. This is a style language. It cannot do anything alone. It is meant to style markup language.</p>

	<p>!TIP! If you want to ensure that the CSS is working on the page, make some dramatic changes to the site's content, such as the background color, to check.</p>

	<h2>Types of CSS</h2>

	<h3>Inline using style attribute</h3>
	<p style="background:pink; font-family:impact;">This can be done by injecting an html tag with the changes that you would like. For example, changing the background of a paragraph or the font that the paragaph uses.</p>
	<p>This can be done by using the attribute style in the p element. </p>
	<p>Ensure that there is a colon between the item that you want to change and then how you want to change it, and a semicolon at the end of the statement. also that the whole thing is in the double quotes. </p>
	<p>Difficulties here come from the fact that if you wanted everything to have a simular look and feel, you would have to change every single element on the page to match.</p>
	<p>How did we know to use certain styles? We can use the documentation (MDN) to find out the different css properties we can use.</p>

	<!--Start of Internal CSS-->
	<h3>Internal CSS use the < style>< /style> tags in the head</h3>
	<p>We use internal CSS when we want to change the way that all of the elements on a page look without changing each individual element every time we want to make a change to the site's appearance.</p>
	<p>The way to do this CSS is at the head of the html.</p>
	<p>WE create a style tag that we can put our desired changes into. </p>
	<p>write the element name, for example body. Then, add a sest of curly braces. body{}.</p>
