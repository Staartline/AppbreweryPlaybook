	<h1>Loops</h1>
	<div>
		<p>We use loops when we want to repeat some code or activity for some certain amount of times, or under certain conditions. </p>
		<h2>While Loops</h2>
		<p>Does a thing while the condition is true</p>

		<p>While (condition){
			some code;
		}</p>

		Stops when the code is done 

		continue - > stops the current loop, and starts the next loop
		break - > stops the loop 

		Issues: If you forget to increment, then the win condition to stop loop creates an infinite loop

		<p>Beer Bottle Lyrics.</p>
		<p>In this case, I would want to separate each line with a \n newline character, but have opted to use < br> instead as to separate the lines when displayed in html</p>
	</div>

	<button onclick="javascript:beer(20);">Click here to run beer function</button>
	<p id="displayresult">check output in console</p>


	<div>
		<h2>For Loop</h2>
		<p>Defines a loop that starts, ends, and has some change. Used for when we want to do something for some number of times. </p>
		<p>for(start; end; increment){some code}</p>
		<p>Can count in any direction and use different increments.</p>
		<p>Use while when checking for a state, and use for when you know how many times you want to run a loop.</p>

		<p>Fibo Code Challenge</p>
		<p>Take two numbers, and every number after that adds the next two numbers. First two numbers are [0, 1] </p>
		<p>Bonus reading on finding the last elements of an array <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-the-last-item-in-an-array-in-javascript/" target="_blank">read about it here.</a></p>
		<button onclick="javascript:fibbo(10);">press here to run</button>
		<p id="f2">Results for fibbo here</p>

		<p>Note! If you start counting from 0, your stop condition will be x < stop. If you start counting from 1, your stop condition will be x <= stop.</p>
