	<h1>Section 1 Notes</h1>
	<h2>What is the Internet</h2>
	<p>The internet consists of a wire that connects all computers worldwide together.</p>
	<p>The internet works on a Server and Client basis, where a client requests a file and the server is the computer that delivers the file.</p>
	<p>Requests are sent from a client to the ISP, that serves the internet. The request is sent to the DNS server, which translates domain names (URLS) to the IP address of a website. All computers connected to the internet has an IP address, and you can find a website IP address using NSlookup. </p>

	<h2>How do Websites Work?</h2>
	<p>Websites work with HTML, CSS and Javascript files.</p>
	<p>HTML -> The Content of the page including the format and the text.</p>
	<p>CSS -> This is the appearance of the website.</p>
	<p>Javascript -> This is the functionality of the website.</p>
	<p>After revieving a website from the internet, our browser can interpret these files. HTML loads the framework, CSS makes it look as intended, and JS lets us try what we need the site to do. </p>
