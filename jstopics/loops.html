	<h1>Loops</h1>
	<div>
		<p>We use loops when we want to repeat some code or activity for some certain amount of times, or under certain conditions. </p>
		<h2>While Loops</h2>
		<p>Does a thing while the condition is true</p>

		<p>While (condition){
			some code;
		}</p>

		Stops when the code is done 

		continue - > stops the current loop, and starts the next loop
		break - > stops the loop 

		Issues: If you forget to increment, then the win condition to stop loop creates an infinite loop
