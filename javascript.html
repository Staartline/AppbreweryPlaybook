			<h1>Javascript</h1>
			<p>Some sites require JS to be able to function, such as youtube.</p>
			<p>Javascript is a script used to command different parts of the site to function differently. This can also be used to make buttons function and so forth.</p>
			<p>Also Java and Javascript have no relation. Java is a compiled langauage while javascript is interpreted.</p>
			<p>Supported by all major browsers.</p>

		<div class="item usage">
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>We use the Script Tags < script>< /script></p>

			<p>View -> Developer -> Js Console</p>

			<p>You can write multiline scripts by using shift+enter.</p>
			<p>You can also write snippits in chrome. This can be used to write as many lines of code as desired.</p>
			<p>You know what, though? Firefox has a multi-line editor (use ctrl+enter) to write multiline codes.</p>

			<h2>Data Types</h2>
			<p>The way that data is classified so that a computer knows how to use that data.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>String -> always between a set of "" or ''</li>
				<li>Int -> These are your whole numbers</li>
				<li>boolean -> true or false</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Variables</h2>
			<p>You can use this to store a value that can then be used later.</p>
			<p>This can be done by storing things like names, values, or ambitions, which can later be used.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we can change the value of the variable.</p>

			<p>Declared using var variablename;</p>
			<h3>Variable Naming</h3>
			<p>You should give variables meaningful names that we understand. This is so that we understand what the variables contain. We aren't allowed to call variables var.</p>
			<p>Variable names cannot begin with numbers, but can contain numbers</p>
			<p>Variable names cannot contain spaces. </p>
			<p>There are some characters that cannot be in the name</p>
			<p>Use camelcase lowercaseUppercaseUppercase.</p>


			<h2>Comments</h2>
			<p>// SIngleline comment</p>
			<p>/*Multiline comment*/</p>

			Functions are used to remove repetitions and can be used for debugging. 
			Functions named using camelcase


			Parameters and Arguments
			Parameters go between the ()
			Arguments are used when the function is called, and goes between the (). 

			Functions do not always need to take an argument.

			function functionName(inputparameter);
			functionName(parameter);

			parameters are used to take in a value or variable which will then be used somewhere inside of the function. 

			math.floor(value); rounds the number down
			math.ceiling(value); rounds the number up


			functions that can give an output end with a return. This means that the function can both take an input and export an output. we can return a variable or a calculated value.

			function getPogs(money){
			    return money % 2;
			}

			getPogs(5);
			returns 1. 


			Functions resources: 
			It allows us to use functions inside of functions. This means that we can call a function inside of a function, and have the function return some value, which is then used inside of our first function.
			function function1(value){
			    function2(value);

			}

			function function2(value){
			    value+=2;


			}

			Useful when changing multiple values and replacing them with variable values.

			BMI calculator. 
			BMI = weight kg / height ^2(m^2)

			function bmiCalc(height, weight){
			    var BMI = weight/(height * height)
			    console.log("Your BMI is " + BMI )
			    return BMI;
			    
			}

			Math.pow(base, exponent)

			Math.round(value) ->rounds a number

			SEt your expectations
			Programming is hard, but setting your expectations is important. Do not get ahead of yourself, but do not downplay what you are doing. 
			More work is more results.

			<p>Love Calculator?</p>
			<p>Random Number - > Math.random(); Generates a number between 0-.9999... Never reaches 1, but can be 0. Creates a psuedo random float.</p>
			<p>We can multiply this by 100 to get the percentage. </p>
			<p>To give it a range, we can take some n, multiply it by the number of prob that we want, and then use a floor function on it. to make sure it is never 0, we have to add 1 to this. </p>

		<div>
			<p>Best practice is to put the script element at the ending of the body section. < script> element. This is because the page is rendered from top to bottom, so it will display information before parsing the code. The second thing is that the script needs to talk to the predefined elements that are already on the page. Putting this on the bottom ensures that elements are already rendered</p>
