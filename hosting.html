	<h1>Hosting Sites Using Github</h1>
	<p>A website can be hosted using GitHub or another domain service (such as GoDaddy), instead of just locally. </p>
	<p>In short: websites can be built locally using a file structure, but to view it online or share it with your friends worldwide you must host it online.</p>
