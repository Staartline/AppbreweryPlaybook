	<h1>Loops</h1>
	<p>We use loops when we want to repeat some code or activity for some certain amount of times, or under some certain condition. </p>
	<p>Use while loops when checking for a state, and use for loops when you know how many times you want to run a loop.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>While Loops</h2>
		<p>Runs while a condition is true, and stops when the condition is false.</p>
		<p>Issues: If you forget to increment the condition, then the code continues to run, creating an infinite loop</p>
		
		<p>while(condition){ <br>
			some code;<br>
			incrementcondition;<br>
		}<br></p>

		<h3>Loop Controls</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>continue - > stops the current loop, and starts the next loop</li>
			<li>break - > stops the loop </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Beer Bottle Lyrics</h3>
		<p>The lyrics to 99 Bottles of beer can be used to create a function that counts down from some given number.</p>
		<p>Note! In this case, if I were publishing these lyrics to a text file, I would use a \n newline character, but have opted to use < br> instead as to separate the lines when displayed in html.</p>
		<button onclick="javascript:beer(20);">Click here to run (Test case is 20)</button>
		<p id="displayresult">check output in console, or right here.</p>
	
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>For Loops</h2>
		<p>Creates a loop that starts, ends, and has some change. Used for when we want to do something for some number of times that we know.</p>
		<p>for(start; end; increment){somecode;}</p>
		<p>The increment increases at the end of the current iteration of the loop.</p>
		<p>It is possible to count in either direction, and use different increments as well.</p>
		<p>Note! If you start counting from 0, your stop condition will be x < stop. If you start counting from 1, your stop condition will be x <= stop.</p>
		
		<h3>Fibo Code Challenge</h3>
		<p>Take two numbers, and every number after that adds the previous two numbers in the sequence. First two numbers are [0, 1] </p>
		<p>Bonus reading on finding the last elements of an array -> <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-the-last-item-in-an-array-in-javascript/" target="_blank">read about it here.</a></p>
		<button onclick="javascript:fibbo(10);">press here to run (Test case is 10)</button>
